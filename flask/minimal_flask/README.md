minimal flask app from:
tutorial http://www.compjour.org/lessons/flask-single-page/hello-tiny-flask-app/
https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flask

python + flask + gunicorn + heroku (+ pipenv)

minimum required number of files to make an app = 4:
- app.py : you app, with app-y stuff inside
- requirements.txt (or Pipfile) : tells heroku which python libraries you want to run the app
- runtime.txt : tels heroku which version of python to use
- Procfile : tells heroku what to do (the heroku app 'cli' on their server)
    - web: gunicorn app:app --log-file -
    - means run a WEB process (app) using GUNICORN with app named 'app' of type APP (:app) and LOG OUTPUTS (--log-file) to stdout (the last '-')

steps (from zero):
1. install python
2. install pipenv using 'pip install pipenv'
3. make new virtual environment by going to new folder and typing 'pipenv install'
4. start (work inside) virtual environment by typing 'pipenv shell'
5. install flask and gunicorn with 'pipenv install flask gunicorn'
6. WRITE APP (make the 4 files mentioned above) : besides app.py, all files can be written in a text editor (notepad)
7. start git to keep track of stuff with 'git init'
8. then tell git to group all your app things together with 'git add .' (. means everything in the folder and subfolders)
9. then prepare app for pushing with 'git commit -m "i created my first git commit yay" '
10. login to heroku with 'heroku login'
11. create app on heroku with 'heroku create'
12. PUBLISH APP with 'git push heroku master'

notes:
- install git cli and heroku cli first please
- when initializing pipenv install, sometimes it says language not set https://bugs.python.org/issue18378
- don't forget to type pipenv shell before editing your work, so that you work in a virtual environment
- sometimes pipfile and pipfile.lock is wrongly generated by pipenv
    - current method: make virtual environment with pipenv, then pip freeze to make requirements in that virtual environment
    - pip freeze > requirements.txt
